Hello Guys , This facebook application is created as a result of the facebook hackathon contest 2012 by KRDS . 

The Idea was to use the Facebook Framework to bring friends together for a common cause of disscussing against Corruption and taking actions 
against it by the way of filing petions to govt. officials and also taking part in online elections .

To test the app :

1. Install wamp
2. enable php curl extension
3. make a folder in www of wamp and access the folder from browser after wamp is restarted (ie after changing php curl setting)
4. if folder is fb2 ---- > http://localcost/fb2
5. But before all that you have register an app in facebook developers. Instructions are given there.
